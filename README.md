Braindance is a terminal utility for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) — an AI coding agent. It does two things:

1. **Auto-switches Claude's "mindset"** based on time of day — you get the right model for the right task without touching config
2. **Helps you discover and install Claude Code skills** — superpowers, memory, design guidance, and more from the best open-source repos

Inspired by the Cyberpunk 2077 concept of **braindance** — switching between different perceptual layers to experience the same world differently. Your coding environment, different mindsets.

---

## How it Works

Claude Code works with backend AI models (like Opus for deep reasoning, Sonnet for balanced work, Haiku for quick tasks). Different work needs different models — but manually switching between them is friction.

**Braindance automates this.** You install it once, add one line to your shell config, and forget about it. Every new terminal session, Braindance reads the current IST time and exports the right environment variables so Claude Code uses the optimal model preset.

No daemons. No background processes. No 200MB dependency installs. It's a shell script — it runs in milliseconds and disappears.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AjayVasan/Claude-Braindance.git
cd Claude-Braindance
bash install.sh
exec $SHELL
braindance --check
claude
```

The installer walks you through:
1. Detecting your OS and shell
2. Copying files to `~/.local/share/braindance/`
3. Symlinking `braindance` to your PATH
4. Optionally adding shell integration to your config
5. Optionally storing your API key

| Mindset | Time Window (IST) | Opus | Sonnet | Haiku | When to use |
|---------|-------------------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `daily-coding` | 00:00-06:29 (default) | GLM-4.7 | GLM-4.7 | GLM-4.5-Air | General dev, quick tasks |
| `deep-thinking-offpeak` | 06:30-11:29, 15:30-23:59 | GLM-5.2 | GLM-4.7 | GLM-4.5-Air | Architecture, planning, debugging |
| `deep-thinking-peak` | 11:30-15:30 | GLM-5-Turbo | GLM-4.7 | GLM-4.5-Air | Deep work during peak hours |
| `docs-utility` | Manual (`claude-doc` alias) | GLM-4.7 | GLM-4.5-Air | GLM-4.5-Air | Documentation, formatting, logs |

Override anytime: `braindance preset deep-thinking-offpeak`

The ±60s grace window at 11:30 prevents boundary glitches.

### Preset Switch Output

```bash
$ braindance preset deep-thinking-peak
[braindance] Mindset switched: deep-thinking-offpeak → deep-thinking-peak

  Opus:        GLM-5.2              → GLM-5-Turbo
  Sonnet:      GLM-4.7              → GLM-4.7
  Haiku:       GLM-4.5-Air          → GLM-4.5-Air

[braindance] Use 'braindance preset reset' to revert to time-based.
```

Switching to the same preset prints current state without re-applying:

```bash
$ braindance preset deep-thinking-peak
[braindance] Already on preset: deep-thinking-peak
  Opus:   GLM-5-Turbo
  Sonnet: GLM-4.7
  Haiku:  GLM-4.5-Air
```

## Provider Setup

### Z.ai (default)

Braindance is built for [Z.ai](https://z.ai) — an Anthropic-compatible API proxy.

```bash
braindance set-key sk-your-zai-api-key
braindance --check
```

This exports:
| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your Z.ai API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | Per preset |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | Per preset |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | Per preset |

### Other providers

Swap in any Anthropic-compatible API by creating a custom preset:

```bash
cp presets/daily-coding.env presets/my-provider.env
# Edit ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and model names
braindance preset my-provider
```

---

## Shell Integration

The installer adds this to your shell config (with permission):

```bash
# .zshrc or .bashrc
export BRAINDANCE_DIR="${BRAINDANCE_DIR:-$HOME/.local/share/braindance}"
[[ -f "$BRAINDANCE_DIR/src/main.sh" ]] && source "$BRAINDANCE_DIR/src/main.sh"
alias claude-doc='BRAINDANCE_PRESET_OVERRIDE=docs-utility command claude'
```

To regenerate the snippet: `braindance shell`

### Auto-Notification + Auto-Switch (Precmd Hook)

Once sourced, Braindance registers a lightweight shell hook that watches for time-window crossings. When the clock passes a boundary (e.g., 11:30 → peak), it **automatically exports the new ANTHROPIC_* vars** to your live shell and shows:

```
[braindance] ⏰ Auto-switched: deep-thinking-offpeak → deep-thinking-peak
  Opus:        GLM-5.2              → GLM-5-Turbo
  Sonnet:      GLM-4.7              → GLM-4.7
  Haiku:       GLM-4.5-Air          → GLM-4.5-Air
```

The transition notification is also **persisted to disk** (`$BRAINDANCE_DIR/last_transition`) so it survives even if you're inside a running program (like `claude`) when the transition happens.

No manual re-source needed. No background processes — just a `precmd`/`PROMPT_COMMAND` hook that runs in <1ms. Skips entirely when a manual override is active.

### What happens to in-flight work?

The precmd hook only fires when the **shell prompt** (`$`) is displayed. If you're inside `claude` typing a message when a time-crossing occurs:

1. **Your running claude session is untouched** — it continues with the models it started with
2. **Transition is saved** to `$BRAINDANCE_DIR/last_transition` at the next shell prompt (after you exit claude)
3. **Your old prompts are NEVER re-sent** to the new model — conversation history stays in the chat as context
4. **Next `claude` launch** shows the notification and auto-resumes your conversation with the new models:

```
$  ← back at shell prompt
[braindance] ⏰ Auto-switched: offpeak → peak  ← precmd fires

$ claude
━━━ braindance ⏰ Models Changed ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  deep-thinking-offpeak → deep-thinking-peak
  Opus:  GLM-5.2 → GLM-5-Turbo
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[braindance] deep-thinking-peak | opus: GLM-5-Turbo
```

**No data loss. No re-processed messages. Zero disruption.**

### Notification display chain

The `last_transition` file is shown in three places, then cleaned up:

| Step | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | **Shell prompt** (precmd) | `braindance_precmd_check` writes the file on transition |
| 2 | **claude() wrapper** (in `.zshrc`) | Next `claude` command reads + deletes the file before forwarding to claude |
| 3 | **SessionStart hook** (inside claude) | If wrapper cleaned it, SessionStart won't see it; if not, it's shown at session start |
| 4 | **File deleted** | After first display by either handler |

## Design Philosophy

Built via adversarial multi-agent planning (hyperplan mode) with four specialists debating every decision:

- **Pragmatist** kept scope tight — shell-first, no unnecessary deps
- **Architect** drew clear component boundaries — 4 files, not 8
- **Deep-thinker** caught 25 edge cases, distilled to 6 essential ones
- **Innovator** pushed for delight — `--check` diagnostic mode, skills ecosystem

**Key decisions:**
- **Shell, not Python/Go** — env vars must be set in the parent shell; only `source` can do that
- **No LiteLLM** — 200MB+ dependency for an env var switcher is absurd
- **No daemon** — runs once at session start in <5ms, then exits
- **Opt-in shell integration** — never modifies `.zshrc` without asking
- **Documented migration path** — `docs/MIGRATION.md` for when Go becomes necessary
